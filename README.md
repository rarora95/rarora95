Currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at **Georgia Tech**, focusing on Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems. Former Software Engineer at **Cisco** and **Ericsson**with a passion for building high-performance systems and optimizing complex architectures.

## 💼 Professional Experience

I've spent the last few years building impactful software solutions at **Cisco** and **Ericsson** ,  working across the full stack and diving deep into systems-level challenges. My journey has taken me from optimizing CI/CD pipelines to crafting user-centric UIs and architecting backend services that handle real-world scale.

**What I've Built & Achieved:**

At **Cisco**, I focused on performance optimization and full-stack development. I redesigned UI components using **ReactJS** with virtual scroll functionality, dramatically reducing DOM overhead for users working with massive datasets. On the backend, I built RESTful APIs with **Flask** and developed complex filtering systems using **Python** and **PostgreSQL**. I also created intelligent tooling—like a fuzzy string matching algorithm with 90% accuracy—to prevent duplicate ticket creation and boost team productivity. Much of my work involved low-level systems programming on **Linux**, decoding CRFT data streams, and collaborating with senior engineers on architectural decisions.

At **Ericsson**, I made a significant impact on developer velocity by **accelerating the CI pipeline by 94%**—migrating over 200 Perl test cases to a modern testing framework. I contributed to cloud-native architecture migration by implementing the Home Subscriber Server (HSS) Simulator in **Java**, and spent considerable time debugging distributed systems using **Wireshark** for network analysis and packet inspection.

Throughout these experiences, I've grown comfortable working across the stack—from **Angular** and **ReactJS** frontends to **Python** and **Java** backends, all while maintaining a strong focus on performance, reliability, and developer experience.
